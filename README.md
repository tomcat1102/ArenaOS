# ArenaOS (Occupied till 6.12, Have no time to write code, hurry up!!!)
I've always wondered why not write an OS from scratch, since I've read so much OS code and I'm tired of it. Now here comes it! It's like linux 0.11 and the one in https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial but not the exactly the same. 

## Note
You may just browse the assembly and C code. However you cannot compile or run it because there are a bunch of code to write and things to prepare before compiling and booting the system.I recommend you finish the mentioned 'os-tutorial' beforehand. It could and shall take a long time to complete the kernel. Be patient! (I said to myself)

## Future
After I have finished most part of the kernel, I'll update the README and READMEs
in each directory, where I'll explain how to prepare the environment (gdb + qemu),
how to debug, why the assembly codes are writen the way it is line by line.
